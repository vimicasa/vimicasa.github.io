After a long break, I have decided to resume this blog, and additionally in English. You may be wondering why, but the main reason is very clear, **force me to write in english**.
I think it is an aspect that I still have a lot of room to improve so I have decided to go for it.

I also have taken the opportunity to upgrade the blog with a new theme. I already was using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because its simplicity but this time I also wanted to store the repo in [Github](https://github.com/). Combining these requirements I ended up in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

GitHub Pages supports some themes that can be found [here](https://pages.github.com/themes/). I have chosen [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), as the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you.

So here we are, you can find this blog in my Github repo [vimicasa.github.io](https://github.com/vimicasa/vimicasa.github.io). Following Github naming convention, and its feature, this repo is automatically deployed in a subdomain under *your_name.github.io*. 

And just to conclude, Github Pages gives us the option to customize the URL that it is published. Just create a file named CNAME and include your URL. If you want to [Read more](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) about the CNAME.


And that's all for publishing a new theme in this blog.
